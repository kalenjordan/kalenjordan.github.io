title: Hiring Customer Support
---

Looking for someone to join the Commerce Hero team and help with customer
support and outreach.

Looking for 2 hours/day initially and after we finish training, ramp
up to 4 hours/day. Will need you to be available for meetings at
9am Central and 3pm Central - they'll mostly be initially during
training though.

Looking to do $25/hour or roughly $2k/month.

The job will mostly involve handling email customer support, occassional
phone calls, administration of jobs and matches in the backend, and
LinkedIn outreach.

If you're interested, please email kalen at commercehero io with a
little information about yourself!
