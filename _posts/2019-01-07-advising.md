title: Advising
---

Something that I think I'd like to do more of is advising other founders. Some of the things that I think I could help with are:

- Helping a developer founder learn the sales/marketing side of things
- Help to find product/market fit
- Helping products in the eCommerce world get the word out

If that sounds like something you'd be interested in, ping me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/kalenjordan) and tell me a little about your product.
