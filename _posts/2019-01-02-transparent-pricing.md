title: Transparent Pricing

---

I heard a great episode the Tim Ferriss podcast with a startup/tech guy [LINK] who started a restaurant. He brought a number of seemingly simple but important innovations to the standard model that restaurants run on.

One of them being that they charge for reservations. Typical restaurants allow anyone to call in and book a reservation without any real commitment on their end, and because of that there is a standard no-show rate for most restaurants. Because of that, restaurants overbook and you normally have to wait a while even if you do book a reservation and get there on time.

And the other thing unique thing they did is around variable pricing--the price to go there on a Tuesday afternoon is different from the price on a Saturday evening. Pretty simple and makes sense, but not something that most people in the restauarant industry are used to, so many people told him he was crazy.

Turns out it worked incredibly well--of course it doesn't hurt that his partner is an amazing chef. But they are booked out some insanely long period of time into the future--all bookings are done online. It's pretty cool.

I was talking to a buddy recently about pricing discounts for their agency, and it made me draw some analogies to this.

In the same way that variable restaurant pricing is obvious and at the same time unusual, the same is true for development agencies. They all charge different rates in different situations:

- Grandfathered-in customers on lower rates
- Lower rates during times when they have excess capacity on their team
- Discounted rates for bigger or more prestigious clients

My hunch tells me that in the same way the transparent pricing was frowned upon but ultimately successful in the restaurant industry, the same would be true of transparent, variable pricing in the dev industry.

Grandfathered customers unsustainable TBD

Everyone understands that rates vary over time TBD
