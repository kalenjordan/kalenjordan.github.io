title: Podcast donations by voice
---

I’ve been listening to some of the donation drive stuff lately on podcasts that are supported by public radio like Radiolab and some of the Guy Raz stuff, and had a thought.

I’m generally not that into giving to public radio type stuff—the asking usually annoys me and makes me think that they should just have advertisers—even though I do like the idea in theory of non-advertiser-supported content, but in practice it just kind of annoys me.

But I had a thought that even though it kind of annoys me and I’m not that into it, if there was a way to give a relatively small amount just over voice while I was walking my dog, I might do it.

Reducing friction in transactions always increases transaction volume, and there is something so powerfully human about a podcaster saying “hey if you want to give $2 to support us just say ‘okay cool’ right now” and to be able to execute that transaction just by saying “okay cool” or some other phrase.

There’s a very deep connection I think that podcast listeners have to the podcasters they listen to - many times they listen in long form over a long period of time, and it feels like there’s a relationship there. To be able to respond in what would feel like real time to someone you trust deeply via voice feels like it would be such a powerfully human transaction that it would lead to a new wave of financial support for podcasters.
